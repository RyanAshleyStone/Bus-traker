# Bus-traker
This project was to track the bus route from the MIT campus to the Harvard campus. It was challenging and I had fun! But it was the bane of my existence for a bit. I used API's for the first time which it took me a long time to figure out. I didn't quite understand how to make everything work cohesively, but by the end I had my marker moving. 

Before you start, you'll need to download the API from Mapbox.com. Then, make sure and get your own access token on the "access token" page after creating an account. Make sure and open up the file folder, clone and fork the folder, open up your favorite editor and get coding!
